            <p><span id="troisphrases"> Redesign of a website of e-learning of hacking.</span>
</br>How to valorise the penibility of the learning ? </br>
During a week of workshop , we redesigned the concept of the website <a href="https://www.root-me.org/">root-me.org</a> to create an approach of the learning of hacking fully-gamified. The user won't only have to take up a challenge, but will challenge others 
players / apprentice - hacker of same level. </br>
Based on game environments of MMO, the "player" will be encourage to improve his / her skills in hacking at every moment of his day : to win against others, he / she have to know perfectly the knowkings of 
his level ! 
</br>Here we based the experience of learning on the parallel between progress in game, and improving of hacking skills ; but especially on the access of the documentation, very important in this environment : no given answers to newbies, because only the 
self investment in looking for answers, and the penibility of this tasks makes it as much gratifying. 
</br>So the user interface is centered on the progress of the player with access to his statistics from a lots of way, and the rarefaction of the documentation to give it a precius status, in order that the reading of those documentations became the goal of the "student".

         <h4>Context</h4>
         <p> During a workshop of 4 days, we had to work in team of 5 students to redesign an existing website. Nammed "quick & dirty", the idea is to ends the week with a <span>functional prototype</span>, tested and verified. Centered on the UX part of the job, we had to identify the issues of root-me.org, a website of e-learning for hackers. </p>

         <h4>Personas</h4>
         <p> We divided in three types of users that Root-me could welcome on its platform : the <span>"newbie"</span> wich never coded before and have not any knowing about web security and web languages. One user <span>warned concerning web languages</span> but not really about hacking. Lastly, the <span>warned user in hacking</span> who want to train himself / herself
             or become more expert in some field.It permits to us to focus ours reflexions on those type of users, and develop a <span> user journey</span> especially for them. 
       
         </p>

        <img src="works/rootme/personna2.png" alt="lorem ipsum" class="ombre"></div>
        <p class="source"></p>

         <h4>Audit</h4>
         <p>  
             Root-me is a portal of hacking exercices for <span>self-learning</span>, which requires motivation lever to pursue the education alone. But its interface is <span>difficult at first</span>, with a side bar and a top bar to navigate between menus, and 
             a lot of submenus inside them. Whereas the <span>documentation</span> is central in this type of learning, it is not the first item that user can found on a exercice page. Gamified aspect is not fully exploited, with only few statistics at the 
             end of the exercice. Finally, the <span>community </span> is only present of the chatbox on the side, whereas could be a motivation lever for hackers students. So from this audit we extracted a <span>journey map</span> for a new user on the platform.
         </p>
         <img src="works/rootme/xp_map.png" alt="lorem ipsum" class="ombre">
         <p class="source"></p>
         <p> This journey map was usefull to point the positive sides of the service, and <span>localize the weaknesses </span> that we have to fix.
        </p>
        

         <h4>Ideation</h4>

         <p> Because Root-me is a self-learning portal, we focused on the newer users that the platform could welcome. Firstly, we imagined a user journey based on daily MOOCs, but this idea was too floppy, and throwed away few times after to <span>rechallenge</span> it.
            because we are working on a computational subject, we thought that an approach <span>fully-gamified</span> could be an interesting way to encourage to improve his / her skills in hacking . The user won't only have to take up a challenge, but will challenge others 
            players / apprentice - hacker of same level. </br>
            We develop this idea of the <span>time consumed</span> by it at every moment of the day : to win against others, he / she have to know perfectly the knowkings of 
            his level ! 
            </br>The experience will be centered learning on the parallel between <span>progress in game</span> and improving of hacking skills by using a lots <span>statistics </span>. The <span>documentation</span> should not only a way to win a challenge, but also a goal for the player. He / she have to deserve it !
            No given answers to newbies, because only the self investment in looking for answers, and the <span>penibility of this task</span> makes it as much gratifying. 
         </p>

        <h4>Research & UX</h4>
        <p> 
           We based the game environment on those ones of MMO, with an increased importance on documentation and statistics. To materialize his / her progress at every connection on the platform, home will present those elements and some <span>loyalty levers</span> as daily boxes.
           The in-game interface, will be represented as an arena where players could challenge themselves. At every step of its navigation, he / she should have a <span>direct access</span> to its documentation, and a visual on his / her progression.
        </p>

        <p> To proceed efficiently and quickly in the short time we had left, we <span>work by periods</span> of alone work, and group consultations to <span>vote </span> for the best idea concerning a functionality or the future axe we had to work on.</p>

         <h4>User tests</h4>
         <p>
             After finalized a prototype on <span>Sketch</span>, we tested it with some users in order to observe if they <span>easily navigate</span> in our service, if they understand well our entitles... We required that they <span>verbalize</span> their feelings during the test.
             It revealed that the access to documentation was not enough obvious on some interface, and users searched it. We proceeded with <span>many iterations </span> between prototyping and user tests to improve it until it seems fluent to each new user.

            <h4>Word of the end</h4>
            <p> The <a href="https://www.design-sprint.com/">design sprint method</a> was a good experimentation of team working during this workshop. It permits to bring out a new concept, design a viable prototype and test it in one week, in order to resolve
                an existing issue : the motivation drops during self-learning. Even if the final result need tests on targeted audience and a work on UI more developed than the basis we have done to test our prototype, it is quite satisfaying : 4 days centered on a idea, and we are able to determine
                its viability !</p>
